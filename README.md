Chat Application : A real-time chat application built using Node.js, Socket.IO, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When users join the chat room, they are greeted with a pop-up prompting them to enter their name. Once they join, a notification is broadcasted to all participants, indicating the new user has entered the room. The app features an input box and a send button for seamless message exchange. Messages are instantly displayed to all users in real-time, showcasing the power of Socket.IO for bidirectional communication. This project highlights the integration of server-side and client-side technologies to create an engaging and interactive chatting experience.
